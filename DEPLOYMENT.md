### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Code changes committed to git
- [x] `.gitignore` file created to exclude node_modules and test files
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub repository
- [x] Dependencies listed in package.json

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in your Railway/hosting environment:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000 (or use Railway's provided port)
```

### Railway Deployment (Recommended)

1. **If not already connected to Railway:**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI if needed
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Link to existing project or create new
   railway link
   ```

2. **Deploy from GitHub (Preferred):**
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Railway will auto-deploy on push to main branch
   - Your recent push will trigger a deployment

3. **Manual Deploy via CLI:**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Alternative Deployment Options

#### Heroku
```bash
# Add Heroku remote if not exists
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

#### Custom VPS
```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh user@your-server

# Clone/pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start with PM2 (recommended)
pm2 start server.js --name mindos
pm2 save
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Check Application Health:**
   - Visit: `https://your-app-url/health`
   - Should return JSON with status "ok"

2. **Test Key Features:**
   - [ ] User registration/login
   - [ ] Feed loading
   - [ ] AI bubble interface opens when clicking brain icon
   - [ ] Quick actions appear in bubble
   - [ ] Messages send successfully
   - [ ] Pinning system works
   - [ ] Task completion updates status

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Railway
   railway logs
   
   # Heroku
   heroku logs --tail
   
   # PM2
   pm2 logs mindos
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Issues:**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check SSL settings match production requirements
   - Ensure database is accessible from deployment environment

2. **Claude API Issues:**
   - Verify CLAUDE_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Check API key hasn't expired
   - Monitor usage limits

3. **Module Not Found Errors:**
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json (not devDependencies)
   - Run `npm install` in production environment
   - Check Node.js version matches requirements (>=18.0.0)

### Rollback if Needed
```bash
# Find previous commit
git log --oneline

# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
